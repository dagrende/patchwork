## Architecture

### Note identity

As notes should be unique among all clients, GUIDs are used as IDs. Each note get a GUID at
creation and keeps it in all clients throughout the board life-time.

### Client

* BoardController
    * Listens to BoardModel changes and updates the user interface
* BoardModel
    * Maintains the Board, Notes, BoardNotes etc
* RemoteEnabler
    * Listens to board changes and uses the transceiver to send to server
    * Calls methods in BoardModel for messages received from the transceiver
* SocketIoTransceiver
    * Communicates with server using Socket.io

## User Interface

* Board
* Note editor

## Communication protocol

* Client sends all model changes as JSON objects to the server
* Server broadcasts all received messages
