* Move placed note
* Un-place note - moving it to your note list
* Edit note text in note list or board
* Leave board by closing web page or navigating to web page

# Implementation

## Architecture

### Note identity

As notes should be unique among all clients, GUIDs are used as IDs. Each note get a GUID at
creation and keeps it in all clients throughout the board life-time.

### Client

![class diagram](http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy;/class/[RemoteEnabler]->[BoardModel], [RemoteEnabler]->[SocketIoTransceiver], [BoardController]->[BoardModel], [SocketIoTransceiver]->[Socket.io])

* BoardController
    * Listens to BoardModel changes and updates the user interface
* BoardModel
    * Maintains the Board, Notes, BoardNotes etc
* RemoteEnabler
    * Listens to method calls to BoardModel and uses the transceiver to send them in JSON form to server
    * Calls BoardModel methods for JSON messages received from the transceiver
* SocketIoTransceiver
    * Communicates with server using [Socket.io](http://socket.io)

## User Interface

![Main board view](app/images/main-board-small.png)

- Top row shows the notes that have not been placed on the board. Click on the green note to create a new note and type a text in the note editor to create a new note.
- Drag a note from the top down to the board to place it. Drag from board to top row to return it to remove it from the board.
- Click on note in top row or in board to edit the text.

![Edit Note view](app/images/edit-note-small.png)

- Edit the text in the text area
- Click ![done](app/images/done-check.png) to save it
- Click ![cancel](app/images/cancel-x.png) to cancel the change
- Click ![waste basket](app/images/delete.png) to delete the note

 All the operations return to the board.


## Communication protocol

* Client sends all model changes as JSON objects to the server
* Server saves all received messages in a board log and broadcasts them to all except the sender
* When a client connects to the server, the server sends back all messages in the board log
